		Base class for 4D wireframe meshes.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		WireMesh4D is the base class for all 4D wireframe meshes. Wireframe meshes are defined using vertices and edges, where each edge is defined by two vertices. Wireframe meshes are used to represent outlines of 4D objects using lines, similar to wireframe meshes in 3D.
		Most of the wireframe functionality is also available for tetrahedral 4D meshes, therefore the methods to get the vertices and edges are defined in the parent [Mesh4D] class. To make a WireMesh4D, use one of the descendant classes, such as [ArrayWireMesh4D] or [BoxWireMesh4D]. Advanced users can create custom wireframe mesh classes by extending WireMesh4D.

		<method name="wire_mesh_clear_cache">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				WireMesh4D caches the edge positions for performance reasons. This method clears the cache, forcing the edge positions to be recalculated the next time they are requested. You should run this method if you are making your own [WireMesh4D]-derived class and you change the vertices or cells. You do not need to run this when using the built-in classes such as [ArrayWireMesh4D] or [BoxWireMesh4D], they will automatically clear the cache when needed.
