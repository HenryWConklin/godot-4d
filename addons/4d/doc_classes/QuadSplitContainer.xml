	<description>
		QuadSplitContainer is a container that can handle up to four children. It is like an [HBoxContainer] and [VBoxContainer] combined. The layout can be set to have anywhere between 1 and 4 children visible. If 2 or 3 children are visible, the layout will be split depending on the dominant side. The splits are draggable by the user to change the ratio of the visible children.

				Set the layout of the QuadSplitContainer. The layout can be set to have anywhere between 1 and 4 children visible. If 1 or 4 children are visible, [param dominant_side] has no effect. If 2 or 3 children are visible, the layout will be split depending on [param dominant_side].
				With 2 children, [param dominant_side] set to [constant @GlobalScope.SIDE_TOP] or [constant @GlobalScope.SIDE_BOTTOM] will split the layout vertically, while [constant @GlobalScope.SIDE_LEFT] or [constant @GlobalScope.SIDE_RIGHT] will split the layout horizontally.
				With 3 children, [param dominant_side] determines which side has a child taking up the most space. The other two children will be split on the opposite side. For example, [constant @GlobalScope.SIDE_RIGHT] will have the first Control taking up half the width on the right, and the other two Controls will be split vertically on the left.
