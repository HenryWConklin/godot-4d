	<brief_description>
		Allows adding 4D collision shapes in the scene.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		CollisionShape4D is the 4D equivalent of [CollisionShape2D] and [CollisionShape3D]. It exists to allow placing 4D collision shapes in the scene, which are used by physics bodies.
		Do not scale CollisionShape4D nodes, as it will cause problems with physics. Instead, change the size of the [Shape4D] resource it contains. The transformation basis of a CollisionShape4D node should always be orthonormal, meaning unscaled and unskewed.

	<methods>
		<method name="get_hypervolume" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="float" />
			<description>
				Returns the hypervolume of the shape in quartic meters, using the shape's [method Shape4D.get_hypervolume] function.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_nearest_global_point" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Vector4" />
			<param index="0" name="point" type="Vector4" />
			<description>
				Returns the point in global space that is nearest to the given point in global space, using the shape's [method Shape4D.get_nearest_point] function.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_support_global_point" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Vector4" />
			<param index="0" name="direction" type="Vector4" />
			<description>
				Returns the point in global space that is the farthest in the given direction, known as the support point, using the shape's [method Shape4D.get_support_point] function. This is commonly used in collision detection algorithms.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_surface_volume" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="float" />
			<description>
				Return the surface volume of the shape in cubic meters, using the shape's [method Shape4D.get_surface_volume] function.
				[b]Note:[/b] This method may not give the correct result if the shape node is scaled non-uniformly. It is best practice to not scale physics nodes; instead scale the shape resource attached to the physics shape node.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="has_global_point" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="bool" />
			<param index="0" name="point" type="Vector4" />
			<description>
				Returns [code]true[/code] if the shape contains the given point in global space. Points exactly on the surface are considered inside.
