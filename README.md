# Godot 4D

Node4D and other 4-dimensional types for making 4D games in Godot.

## Versions

This repo can be compiled either as an engine module or a GDExtension.
Both fully support all features, but only the engine module has
documentation showing up in the editor.

This repo only supports Godot 4.3 and later. There are no plans to
support Godot 3.x, as it is missing critical Variant data types.
