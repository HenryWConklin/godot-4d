		A 4D game object, inherited by all 4D-related nodes.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		A 4D game object, with a 4D transformation. All 4D nodes inherit from Node4D.
		Has a transform with a [member position] [Vector4] and a [member basis] [Basis4D] (exposed as a [Projection]). The basis can be decomposed into a [member scale] [Vector4] and [member rotation] [Euler4D] (exposed as an [AABB]).

	<methods>
		<method name="apply_scale">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="ratio" type="Vector4" />
			<description>
				Apply a scale to this [Node4D] in the parent-relative space. If you want to scale in object-local space, just multiply [member scale].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="is_visible_in_tree" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="bool" />
			<description>
				Returns [code]true[/code] if the [Node4D] is visible in the scene tree (this node and all parent [Node4D]s are visible).
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="translate_local">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="offset" type="Vector4" />
			<description>
				Translate this [Node4D] in object-local space. If you want to translate in parent-relative space, just add to [member position].

			Specifies how rotation is displayed in the editor. In Euler4D mode, [member rotation_degrees] is displayed as an [Euler4D] (exposed as an [AABB]), and the [member scale] is also displayed.
