		Allows adding 4D collision shapes in the scene.

	<description>
		CollisionShape4D is the 4D equivalent of [CollisionShape2D] and [CollisionShape3D]. It exists to allow placing 4D collision shapes in the scene, which are used by physics bodies.
		Do not scale CollisionShape4D nodes, as it will cause problems with physics. Instead, change the size of the [Shape4D] resource it contains. The transformation basis of a CollisionShape4D node should always be orthonormal, meaning unscaled and unskewed.
