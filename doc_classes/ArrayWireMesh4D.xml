		Custom 4D wireframe mesh class.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		ArrayWireMesh4D is a class for specifying wireframe meshes with arrays of data, including the vertices and edges. Unlike the specialized [WireMesh4D] classes such as [BoxWireMesh4D], ArrayWireMesh4D can store any wireframe mesh, allowing users to create custom meshes with arbitrary data.

		<member name="edge_indices" type="PackedInt32Array" setter="set_edge_indices" getter="get_edge_indices" default="PackedInt32Array()">
			The indices of the edges. Every 2 integers defines an edge. Each integer is an index to the [member vertices] array. Integers in this array should not exceed the length of the vertices array, or else the mesh is invalid.
		</member>
		<member name="vertices" type="PackedVector4Array" setter="set_vertices" getter="get_vertices" default="PackedVector4Array()">
			The vertices of the wireframe mesh. Each Vector4 in this array is a vertex defined as a position in meters in 4D space. The items in this array are referenced by the [member edge_indices] array.
